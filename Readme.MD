Unless the answer contains confidential information explicitly, any questions I was asked, I may post answers here. Your questions may be your IP, but my answer is my IP.

Certifications and skills that might be useful:

SnowPro certification (Snowflake data warehouse) - I found quite a few fin-tech or internet companies using them, such as Gitlab, Prospa, Accenture etc.
Mongo DB什么时候适合用 [https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/an-introduction-to-change-streams]

NoSQL-ElasticSearch

Data integration:Kafka,Nifi. Data Wrangling:Lavastorm (COnsulting)
Mongo (document DB)might be a way to capture change, otherwise new columns/rename may break UI
## Selected interview records:

### Gitlab (a remote company):

passed online screening (SQL questions and behaviour, purpose questions, no time limit);
didn't pass US remote HR lady round on question like "why you choose gitlab) (just 18 min video call and no further response)

Possible reasons: could be location? or culture fit

### Prospa

passed online ETL python test (time suggested 90 minutes) , did a code review regarding formatting, devops, pipeline

### Toptal

Online SQL test with time limit, moderate difficulty

### freelancer

Online Python/SQL test with time limit

###

## tell fake data scientist

A few that I particularly like:
1) Explain a p-value
2) Explain how diversity reduces error and bias in ensemble methods
3) How do gradient boosting and bagging differ theoretically (and in deployment within a system)
4) Name and explain 3 different dimensionality reduction strategies
5) Explain boostrapping and its practical uses in machine learning
6) Explain the math behind PageRank and how linear algebra in general can be used on graph/network problems
7) How would you explain random forest to a kindergartener using the objects in this room
8) Explain one contribution of topology/geometry to the field of statistics and machine learning in detail
9) When is it not appropriate to use deep learning methods on a problem
10) Explain Bayes Theorem in layman's terms
11) Why is a control group necessary for testing
Those should cover a breadth of important topics and give an idea of a person's depth as a data scientist beyond knowing the basics behind buzz-words.
